# Mawma this is garbage... I'm lying, it is not. At least for now (10/01/2022) these are/will be a couple of 
# silly programs I'll be coding to practise all the new stuff I'll be learning about this fascinating script 
# named Python. As you may already know (lmao I'm writing this for myself) I'm self-taught person. I'm self 
# made. An autodidact (that means that I love researching. Investigating. Scrutinizing the inter web if you 
# will, in order to acquire new valuable knowledge). 
# I'm a very knowledgeable person as you may or may not have noticed by the evident sapience exuded by the 
# accoutrements embellishing this delicate paragraph prefacing what could possibly be the proof of –and precursor
# to– a new Valentin era.
# Enough dilly dallying. Ladies and gentlemen and everything in between... I present to you THE CODE.
